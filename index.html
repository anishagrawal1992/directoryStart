          <li><h2>City Garden</h2>
            <a href="#img5" rel="modal:open"><img src=Images/thumbnails/CityGarden.jpg></a>
            <p>The plant palette collectively devised by the designers, Gateway Foundation, and the horticulturalists at the Missouri Botanic Garden emphasizes native Missouri trees, shrubs, grasses, groundcovers, and wildflowers. Plant selections were made and planting designs were developed to ensure the long-term success of the plants, and emphasize the four distinct seasons. Plant species and cultivars were chosen for their urban and drought tolerance, and most plant choices and their specific locations were determined by their relative hardiness and particular tolerances for varying degrees of sun, shade, wetness and/or dryness. In addition, the opportunity to use this project for teaching purposes was fundamental to the planting and soil strategy, in both design and technical detail. This will be an urban botanical garden of sorts, with plants and garden areas labeled, and with every intention of using the design to demonstrate sustainable garden practices in urban settings.</p>

          <li><h2>The Muny</h2>
            <a href="#img10" rel="modal:open"><img src=Images/thumbnails/TheMuny.jpg></a>
            <p>The dream of St. Louisans for a permanent outdoor theatre in Forest Park probably dates back to the 1904 World's Fair. The realization of that dream began in 1916 with plans for an outdoor production of AS YOU LIKE IT by Margaret Anglin's Shakespearean troupe. And the dream became a reality in 1917 with the construction of the Municipal Theatre for six performances of AIDA, produced for the 13th Annual Convention of Advertising Clubs of the World. In 1916, Parks Commissioner Nelson Cunliff, Miss Anglin and Civic League President John Gundlach selected a grassy area between two large oak trees for a June series of performances of Shakespeare's AS YOU LIKE IT. Shrubs and small trees were cleared from the sloping hillside and a retaining wall built to level the performing area. AS YOU LIKE IT starred Miss Anglin, Robert Mantell and Sidney Greenstreet. The out-of-town professionals were joined by nearly 1,000 St. Louis folk dancers and folk singers in observance of the 300th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare. Crowds averaged 8,000, reviews were good, and after an opening night rain-out, AS YOU LIKE IT moved into the history books as the first production at the site of today's Muny.</p>
